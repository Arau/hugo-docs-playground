Running StorageOS as a daemonset is not supported in OpenShift 3.7, but you can
still deploy StorageOS by running directly in Docker.

```bash
title: Install StorageOS managed by systemd, using Ansible
git clone https://github.com/storageos/deploy.git storageos
cd storageos/openshift/deploy-storageos/storageos-ansible-oc-37

title: Update hosts to your hostnames and ip addresses
nano hosts
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yaml
```
If this is your first installation you may wish to follow the [StorageOS Volume
guide](/docs/install/{{ page.platform }}/firstvolume/) for an example of how
to mount a StorageOS volume in a Pod.

OpenShift 3.6 and earlier are not supported.
